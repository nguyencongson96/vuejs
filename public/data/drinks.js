        summary:
            'The Rosita is a modern classic cocktail most often described as a tequila Negroni, though this simplistic explanation vastly undersells the drink. Both involve a combination of spirit, Campari, and vermouth, though the Rosita splits the latter ingredient into equal parts sweet and dry vermouth, making it more akin to a Perfect Negroni. Further, it incorporates a dash of Angostura bitters, to bring added depth to the bittersweet combination.',
        content:
            "The Rosita’s history is murky, like that of so many classic and modern-classic drinks before it. Iterations of the cocktail date to at least the 1970s, before an early recipe was eventually featured in the Mr. Boston Official Bartender’s Guide. There, it sat buried in the book’s pages for years until eventually being unearth and riffed upon by bar legend Gary “Gaz” Regan.\nAs Regan wrote for The San Francisco Chronicle, in the mid-2000s fellow drinks writer Terry Sullivan had discovered the drink, but upon further conversation between the two, neither could recall where the origins of Sullivan’s Rosita recipe lay. A bit of digging and the pair finally realized where Sullivan had found his information—in Regan’s own 1991 cocktail book, The Bartender’s Bible.\n“I didn't remember putting Rosita in The Bartender's Bible, but it's there all right,” wrote Regan. “Where did I steal that one from, I wondered.”\nThe cocktail continues to work on every level. Regan’s version dials up the amount of tequila, deviating further from the equal-parts Negroni template. Splitting the vermouth to include both sweet and dry iterations creates a smoother tasting drink that avoids the sometimes-cloying profile many Negroni variants get from a full sugary ounce of both Campari and sweet vermouth. The final touch, a single dash of Angostura bitters, helps bring additional backbone to the Rosita, and helps to even out this rebalancing of vermouth.\nThe result is a cocktail that perfectly fits the definition of a “modern classic.” It will appeal to those looking for a new spirit-forward tequila cocktail that avoids the trap of yet-another Margarita riff, or for Negroni fans seeking a variation that goes beyond a simple swap of the main spirit.",

        summary:
            'The Frozen Piña Colada, a combination of rum, pineapple, lime, and coconut, is one of the most iconic drinks in the tropical cocktail canon. But despite its omnipresence in beach bars, pop culture, and 1970s songs about attempted infidelity, it can be hard to find one definitive recipe. As the national drink of Puerto Rico, the cocktail’s ties to the island are indisputable, but from there, the origins and recipe specifications get a bit murky.',
        content:
            'At least two of the Piña Colada’s origin stories go to the Caribe Hilton Hotel in San Juan, where two bartenders, Ramón “Monchito” Marrero and Ricardo García, each laid claim to having first created the cocktail in the 1950s. Another San Juan bartender, Ramón Portas Mignot of Barrachina, asserted he created the cocktail in 1963, and a plaque outside the establishment still touts it as the birthplace of the Piña Colada. Conversely, other stories date the combination of ingredients to the 1800s. The debate as to the true origins of the drink rages on today, and likely won’t be resolved any time soon.\nWhat this trip through ambiguous cocktail history really means is that, despite being a classic cocktail with a 70+ year history, the Piña Colada doesn’t have a definitive “traditional” recipe. For years, particularly during the craft cocktail boom of the early 2000s, many bartenders took to skipping the blender and preparing their Piña Coladas shaken and served on the rocks or over pebble ice, mirroring industry-wide trends that aimed to “class up” drinks that got a bad rap in the 1980s and ’90s. \nHowever, the one thing the two dueling originators of the modern drink, Caribe Hilton and Barrachina, agree upon is that the Piña Colada should be blended and frozen.\nThe Frozen Piña Colada mostly adheres to the classic sour template of spirit, sugar, and citrus in the form of lime juice. However, unlike many other classic examples of sours that use liqueurs or simple syrup to provide sweetness, the Piña Colada relies on the natural sugars found in pineapple, as well as those in cream of coconut. The result is a tropical drink that doesn’t taste sticky-sweet or like artificial sugar, but rather showcases the flavors of tropical fruit.\nImportant to note is the need to use cream of coconut rather than coconut milk. Cream of coconut is a thicker and sweetened product that is needed to create the proper balance in a Frozen Piña Colada. Cream of coconut also has a higher fat content that creates a richer texture and mouthfeel, and provides structure to the cocktail to ensure it doesn’t dilute too quickly after blending.',

So when it came time to create an Espresso Martini for the menu, she naturally reached for tequila instead of the drink’s usual vodka.',
        content:
            '“We started getting a lot of calls for Espresso Martinis, and I was like, how can I make something tasty that still represents our brand?” says Flores-Mercado.\nFlores-Mercado found a balance that would appeal to the nature of the original cocktail while keeping in line with Bar Flores’s vision and offering guests something new. “The earthiness and saltiness of [tequila] blend really well with everything that you think of in an Espresso Martini, like coffee and chocolate,” she says.\nFor the coffee component, Flores-Mercado uses a coffee concentrate from nearby Woodcat Coffee and Caffe Lolita Coffee Liqueur. This combination grounds the cocktail with a deep flavor profile that she likens to piloncillo—unrefined raw sugar that has burnt caramel notes. A small amount of Zucca Rabarbero Amaro rounds out the drink with rich chocolate and bitter orange notes, while lemon oils “brighten it up.”\n“Espresso Martinis are always delicious, but they run a little bit on the sweeter side,” says Flores-Mercado.  “[This] feels like a cocktail and less like a dessert.”\nWhen mixing the drink, Flores-Mercado advises to go easy on the ice in the shaker. “Using less ice and giving it a lot of room for there to be a little bit of air in there is what’s going to give you that really gorgeous thick foam,” she says.',

            'The spritz cocktail is thought to date to the late 1800s in the Veneto region of Italy. At the time, the northeastern territory of modern-day Italy was still a part of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and the word “spritz” was derived from the German word spritzen, meaning to spray or splash.',
        content:
            'As legend goes, visiting Austrians found the local wine of the region too potent and would dilute it with a splash of water. Locally made bitter liqueurs were eventually added for a burst of color and flavor. Soon, the familiar combination of prosecco, bitter liqueur and soda water became the after-work aperitivo of choice.\nWhile the Aperol Spritz has enjoyed global popularity, the spritz takes many forms in Italy. The Campari Spritz is one of many variations that has its own distinctive flavor profile. At about 20.5–28% ABV (depending on which country it is sold) Campari is considerably higher in alcohol than many bitter red liqueurs in the same category. This creates a bigger, bolder and more bitter spritz. Quinine and bright citrus zest blast through the bubbles, while the liqueur’s complex finish lingers. Campari’s deep crimson color acts as a visual indicator of the bottling’s more pronounced flavor profile in comparison to its lighter, orange-hued counterpart.\nThe Campari Spritz is a fresh and delicious staple of the sparkling cocktail category and remains an excellent option for fans of bitter and herbaceous flavors.',

        summary:
            'Midori and blanco tequila are two ingredients that don’t often star in stirred drinks, and even less often together. At his Houston bar Refuge, bartender and owner Bobby Heugel combines the bright-green melon liqueur and a high-quality Highlands tequila expression with bittersweet aperitif Suze for a fruit-forward and gently bitter drink. Garnished with a neon-green cherry, it’s a serious cocktail that doesn’t take itself too seriously.',
        content:
            'Heugel says he was inspired by one of his favorite flavor combinations: agave spirits and melons. Although Midori is often associated with saccharine-sweet Midori Sours, Heugel stresses that the melon liqueur is a quality product that should be respected and used properly. “People forget that Midori is incredibly well-made,” he says. “It just has a rap because of its bright green dyed color, but it’s no different from how Campari is dyed these days.”\nFor the drink’s blanco tequila base, Heugel opts for El Tesoro, an agave-forward Highlands expression with prominent floral and fruity notes that are reflective of the Jalisco terroir. El Tesoro employs several traditional tequila processes that many modern-day distilleries have industrialized, such as the tahona, or stone wheel used to crush agave hearts. While you can swap in another blanco tequila, keep in mind that quality is paramount in a spirit-forward drink like this.\nOnce you have the ingredients on hand, the Greenhorn is easy to construct. “I wanted to make a drink that people could order for a decade,” Heugel says. “I also like the idea that people can make this cocktail at home and at other bars.”',

To others, it’s a fun riff on the classic shaken Daiquiri, accented with a hint of banana. Both parties are correct, but this recipe belongs to the latter camp.',
        content:
            'Fun fact: You don’t need a banana to make a Banana Daiquiri. Instead, you can enlist a good banana liqueur to add the sweet fruity quality that turns this drink into a tropical favorite. There are several banana liqueurs on the market, and they vary wildly in quality. Tempus Fugit crème de banane liqueur is a great choice, if you can find it. Otherwise, aim for an option that limits the artificial ingredients.\nTo get the most out of your Banana Daiquiri, try a few different rums, as the range in styles and flavors will affect the sweetness and balance of the cocktail. Aged rums tend to amplify the oak-induced flavors like vanilla and caramel, while dry unaged rums typically highlight grassier and fruitier notes. Pair that rum with fresh lime juice, because fresh is the best. And, although simple syrup works fine, demerara syrup—which is made from a type of raw cane sugar—brings notes of toffee and molasses.\nThis recipe keeps it simple with shaker tins, but if you do want to employ your blender, combine the ingredients with a handful of ice (be careful not to over-dilute the drink) and a banana. Then give everything a whir until you’re presented with a creamy frozen treat. Both options will taste great, cool you down and conjure feelings of a tropical getaway.',

            'The Spicy Margarita is one variation that has taken hold and never released its grip. It succeeds where so many of its siblings fail. That is to say, it refocuses the classic recipe without losing what’s essential to its success: a timeless blend of sweet, sour, and earthy flavors.\nBlanco tequila remains the star of this show, imbuing the drink with its vegetal agave notes. For the best results, choose one that is made with 100% blue Weber agave. An equal split of orange liqueur and agave syrup adds sweetness, while fresh lime juice provides balance and that characteristic acidity you can’t achieve with bottled sweet-and-sour mix.\nThe key to the Spicy Margarita’s heat is fresh jalapeños, which are muddled in the shaker before the other ingredients are added. Two jalapeño coins, with their seeds removed, will yield a conservatively spicy drink. For a more fiery Spicy Margarita, throw in a third coin—or as many as you can handle.',
